### Bug

- [ ] Reset user allocation form state when dropdown closes

### Project

- [ ] Change "users" to "collaborator" in the allocation dialog
- [ ] Show current user occupation and how many hours the occupation has
- [ ] Show the user if the value is coming from the project or allocated users
- [ ] Select (role) -> production, training and support
      If type is training and support -> Hide type select and leave only the input to set hours
      Add an informative tooltip "since training and support were selected, the collaborator will not have productive hours for this project, therefore man-hours will not be configured", if production
      Tooltip to inform what would be the standard and custom of the role
